## 👋 Welcome
Welcome to [Adora Foundation](https://adorafoundation.org/) space. 

Adora Foundation is a launch pad for social innovation👐. We generate inspirational vision, creative connection and transformational action on a global scale. 

We incubate, test, replicate and scale up evidence-based projects across a maximum diversity of contexts, to achieve proof of concept. From this we refine models, tools and methodologies to contribute to policy and practice, from the smallest locality to the world stage. 🚀
